## SSH Keys

You must have at least one SSH key to deploy a VM:

1. Go to SSH Keys page
2. Click "Create Key" to generate a new key
3. Or click "Import Key" to use an existing key
4. Select the key during VM deployment

## VM States

- **ACTIVE:** VM is running (full billing rate)
- **SHUTOFF:** VM is stopped but resources reserved (full billing rate)
- **HIBERNATED:** VM state saved, resources released (reduced rate: $0.01/hour)
- **DELETED:** VM permanently removed (no charge)

## Billing

- Billing is per-minute for exact usage
- You only pay for the time your VM is running
- Hibernated VMs cost much less than active ones
